I am a web focused developer mostly working using Microsoft .Net technologies. Occasionally, I end up working on non web related projects. I am based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates and work for C4 Advanced Solution as Application Developer.
This is my personal website and blog where I put down my thoughts, solutions to problems and learning notes.

## Stack Overflow

Stackoverflow is a online community I hang around a lot during my free time. You can find me answering questions on Sencha's Ext Js , C# and Java. Here is my flair:

## About this Site

This is a static site powered by Jekyll. The design was done by me and the theme is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/olakara/JekyllMetro). I have used Bootstrap, jQuery, icons from Metro Studio of Syncfusion and Github for hosting the site.

Technicals apart, this is my personal site where I plan to pen down my thoughts, technical experiences that I would like to share. But, the content and opnion that you see here are personal and not related to companies / clients i work with. And regarding the code you see there.. you may use it as per your discretion.

## About this Theme

Jekyll Metro is the result of wanting a clean and new theme for my personal site. I was initially inspired by the [Hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde). but soon I was googling to see if there are any Metro inspired theme available.
Since, I couldn't find one, I decided to built one for myself. One of the main goal of building my own theme was to have a modern responsive theme that looks good on mobile, tablet and desktop.

You are free to use or fork this theme. And any contribution to fixes of issues are welcome.
